description: Update the CHANGELOG with recent changes
---

Update CHANGELOG adding appropriate entries under an Unreleased header for all changes since the last tagged release (read the git history, don't just rely on local context). Do not reference regressions or fixes that were committed but were localised to the implementation and not material against the previous release. Focus instead on what changed since the last release overall.

Follow the existing conventions in the CHANGELOG for labels and prose. Do not generate a commit message.
