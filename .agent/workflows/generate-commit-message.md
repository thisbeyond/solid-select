description: Generate a commit message for staged files.
---

Generate a commit message based on my custom rule for authoring commit messages. Reference any relevant implementation plan and chat history to fully understand the reasoning as well as silently calling git commands to determine the staged file diff. Do not attempt to actually perform git commit with the message. Output it only.
