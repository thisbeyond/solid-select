Commit messages must prioritize 'Why' over 'What' and 'User Impact' over 'File Changes.' Format as a short summary line followed by a blank line and then longer description. Use blank lines to separate different contextual points. Do not reference regressions that were made during the implementation but were never committed. Do not use conventional commit style (do not put feat(name): etc). Keep the language plain and straightforward. Do not add unnecessary adverbs like "seamlessly" or "robust".
